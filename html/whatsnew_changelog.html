	<br>Better support for list files.<br>

	- Labels/references between asm and list files are not mixed anymore.<br>
	- The syntax highlighting for list files has been improved.

<li>
	<span class="changelog-badge changelog-badge-changed">CHANGED</span>
	<br>The "asm-code-lens.includeFiles" setting was removed.<br>
	It is now determined by the file association if the file should be included. Add all files you want asm-code-lens to recognize into the "Assembler file" (for asm files) or "Assembler list file" (for list files) file association.
</li>
